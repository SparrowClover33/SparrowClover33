- I like collecting LPS, keychains, stickers etc. So you can spot me sometimes in some polish conventions!
  
- I'm trying to buy new cosplays to get into conventions, I'm trying to be from some anime or games so far of characters I like or relate, I sadly can't sew for now :(
  
- I can get a bit overhelmed about some stuff, so please try to understand if I might go slow or suddenly off when someone wants to talk to me
    
- I'm sorry if I can come out a bit shy and a little dry in conversations, but I usually walk alone at cons. I'm trying to sociallize so don't be shy about talking some stuff

- I like drawing sometimes, but I'm sadly not talented like artists </3

- So far I'm not wearing eye contacts for cosplays for now, but maybe one day ;)
