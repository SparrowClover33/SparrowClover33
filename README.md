- I like collecting LPS, keychains, stickers etc. So you can spot me sometimes in some polish conventions! ![tumblr_9b4986897d09b591cf5819a9fa000855_061e7bec_75](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/62325a70-fdd1-4486-a929-4f00b29a2a5d)

- I'm trying to buy new cosplays to get into conventions, I'm trying to be from some anime or games so far of characters I like or relate, I sadly can't sew for now :(

- I can get a bit overhelmed about some stuff, so please try to understand if I might go slow or suddenly off when someone wants to talk to me

- I'm sorry if I can come out a bit shy and a little dry in conversations, but I usually walk alone at cons. I'm trying to sociallize so don't be shy about talking some stuff

- I like drawing sometimes, but I'm sadly not talented like artists </3 ![tumblr_33b7af24fa21c5d54d64245c9d5739b6_80046bd0_75](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/12dc31a5-96cb-431b-92f3-132f54dab858)
  
- So far I'm not wearing eye contacts for cosplays for now, but maybe one day ;) ![tumblr_e5a27de2a1cf76d21e70409b44237f67_33125a80_75](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/16e836f9-eadf-4264-b55b-7c63424d5ced)

- I like listening to music! Any types of music, even the ones I hate there's few that I like lolz ![tumblr_20d6a95406bd74a8531a785056ce3752_b1f60374_75](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/84250806-d3dd-47db-9a14-42cde07d6767)

- My favourite animals are birbs! Specific sparrows (duh), magpies, crows, ravens, barn owls and rooks! 

- I'm a sweet tooth... ![tumblr_08bcfb518846e68c85550fbe79acb569_ee2b80f7_75](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/56c24f4a-019a-497f-8be4-aa935139aa3c)
