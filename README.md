- I like collecting LPS, keychains, stickers etc. ![tumblr_9b4986897d09b591cf5819a9fa000855_061e7bec_75](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/62325a70-fdd1-4486-a929-4f00b29a2a5d)

- I can get a bit overhelmed about some stuff, so please try to understand if I might go slow or suddenly off when someone wants to talk to me, thank you! ![tumblr_e5a27de2a1cf76d21e70409b44237f67_33125a80_75](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/16e836f9-eadf-4264-b55b-7c63424d5ced)

- I like drawing sometimes, but I'm sadly not talented like artists </3 ![tumblr_33b7af24fa21c5d54d64245c9d5739b6_80046bd0_75](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/12dc31a5-96cb-431b-92f3-132f54dab858)

- I like listening to music! Any types of music, even the ones I hate there's few that I like lolz ![tumblr_20d6a95406bd74a8531a785056ce3752_b1f60374_75](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/84250806-d3dd-47db-9a14-42cde07d6767)

- My favourite animals are birbs! Specific sparrows (duh), magpies, crows, ravens, barn owls and rooks! 

- I'm a sweet tooth... ![tumblr_08bcfb518846e68c85550fbe79acb569_ee2b80f7_75](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/56c24f4a-019a-497f-8be4-aa935139aa3c)

- Alex's Playhouse fans
- TCOAAL fans
- General people like: homophobes, racists etc. Also PLS DON'T ASK ABT POLITICS ty!
- Horndogs (I sadly met few before </3)
- People who are rude in general
- People copying my skins
- I don't like pointing this out, but close friends (+ the person I'm mentioning without name) of someone who I had drama months ago outside and in PT. They probably know who I am talking about, but I don't wanna get into this conversation again and this also made a scar on me so please DNI thank you!
- Hazbin fans sort of, I like cosplays of ppl but that's pretty much it, I don't hate someone liking it tho
- TADC fans, especially the ones from Safe 1 (same thing like with Hazbin fans that you good if you like it and we good too). I have bad experience with them and I saw there's still some toxicity going around there with copying styles, dramas etc.


IWC:
- People below 17 years old, I often hang out anyways in 18+, but just please then keep interactions to minimum after I compliment you or something before adding me on PT or somewhere else
- I sometimes need some time alone, so I probably move somewhere alone, but please don't cover me or bother when I have DNI, thank you!



Stuff I'm into so far:

- TADC (Almost any Glitch show ngl)
- Uma Musume (a bit, I got a little rusty in game lately sorry TwT)
- Madoka Magica
- Animal Crossing (mostly New Leaf because I only own 3DS)
- Smiling Friends
- Severance
- Ena (Season 1 and 2 obv!)
- There's few more, so ask! I don't bite haha!
  



I'm not giving Discord so far to randoms, hope you understand. Ask for it if you're my friend.

I think that's all, BAII!!
